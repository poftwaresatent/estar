DESCRIPTION

The E* algorithm is a path planner for (mobile) robotics. Unlike A*,
which constrains movements to graph edges, it produces smooth
trajectories by interpolating between edges. Like D*, it supports
dynamic replanning after local path cost changes.


PREREQUISITES

 * Boost Graph Library and smart pointers (http://www.boost.org/).
 * An OpenGL implementation (currently works for Linux and OS X).
   [This is sort of optional, the configure script tries to guess if
   you have OpenGL, but it has never been really tested on a system
   without it.]
 * Doxygen (optional, http://www.doxygen.org/).


BUILDING

 From source tarball:

 $ tar xfvz estar-X.Y.tar.gz
 $ cd estar-X.Y
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ ../configure
 $ make
 $ su -c 'make install'

 Better: Use subversion to check out (or update) a working copy!

 $ svn co https://estar.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/estar/trunk/estar
 $ cd estar
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ ../configure
 $ make
 $ su -c 'make install'

If you want to try it out in a "staged" install (the source
directory), you can use the build-stage.sh script which builds and
installs under estar-X.Y/stage. However, it requires GNU Automake /
Autoconf / Libtool.


DOCUMENTATION

Point your favorite browser to file doc/html/index.html if it exists,
or build it using doxygen by typing (after a successful configuration,
see BUILDING above):

 $ cd build
 $ make doc
