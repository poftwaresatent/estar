URGENT:
* check for GLUT header in configure.ac, and disable building of
  targets that depend on it (bin/test_estar_gfx.cpp,
  bin/test_pnf_gfx.cpp, gfx/Subwindow.cpp, gfx/Viewport.cpp) ACTUALLY,
  can probably exclude the whole gfx/ subfolder...
* this needs: make three separate libraries: libestar, libgfx, and libpnf

not so urgent:
* export script which excludes leftovers/ subdirs, runs autogen.sh,
  and produces source, binary, and documentation tarballs
* write a test for goal removals/additions
* pnf/pnf_cooc could use some optimization and cleanup
* recursive make to simplify maintaining the build system
